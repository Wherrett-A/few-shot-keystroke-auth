  abstract = {In today’s world, user authentication has gained enormous popularity due to dependency on technological devices. Once the user gets access to a system and is authenticated, there are no such mechanisms to constantly verify whether the user is legitimate or illegitimate. Behavioural biometrics can be utilized for continuous user authentication, enhancing overall security. This approach includes various factors to authenticate users such as Keyboard typing patterns, movement of the mouse, adaptive authentication techniques, etc. This paper explores the integration of machine learning techniques for enhancing user-centric security through continuous authentication using keystroke dynamics. Keystroke dynamics, as a behavioural biometric, offers a non-intrusive method to verify user identity based on typing patterns. By continuously monitoring these patterns, our approach aims to strengthen authentication processes without disrupting user experience. This study investigates the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze keystroke dynamics data in real-time, enabling adaptive access control and bolstering overall cybersecurity posture.},

  abstract = {Similarity between objects plays an important role in both human cognitive processes and artificial systems for recognition and categorization. How to appropriately measure such similarities for a given task is crucial to the performance of many machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining methods. This book is devoted to metric learning, a set of techniques to automatically learn similarity and distance functions from data that has attracted a lot of interest in machine learning and related fields in the past ten years. In this book, we provide a thorough review of the metric learning literature that covers algorithms, theory and applications for both numerical and structured data. We first introduce relevant definitions and classic metric functions, as well as examples of their use in machine learning and data mining. We then review a wide range of metric learning algorithms, starting with the simple setting of linear distance and similarity learning. We show how one may scale-up these methods to very large amounts of training data. To go beyond the linear case, we discuss methods that learn nonlinear metrics or multiple linear metrics throughout the feature space, and review methods for more complex settings such as multi-task and semi-supervised learning. Although most of the existing work has focused on numerical data, we cover the literature on metric learning for structured data like strings, trees, graphs and time series. In the more technical part of the book, we present some recent statistical frameworks for analyzing the generalization performance in metric learning and derive results for some of the algorithms presented earlier. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of metric learning in real-world problems through a series of successful applications to computer vision, bioinformatics and information retrieval},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

  abstract = {Keystroke dynamics-the analysis of typing rhythms to discriminate among users-has been proposed for detecting impostors (i.e., both insiders and external attackers). Since many anomaly-detection algorithms have been proposed for this task, it is natural to ask which are the top performers (e.g., to identify promising research directions). Unfortunately, we cannot conduct a sound comparison of detectors using the results in the literature because evaluation conditions are inconsistent across studies. Our objective is to collect a keystroke-dynamics data set, to develop a repeatable evaluation procedure, and to measure the performance of a range of detectors so that the results can be compared soundly. We collected data from 51 subjects typing 400 passwords each, and we implemented and evaluated 14 detectors from the keystroke-dynamics and pattern-recognition literature. The three top-performing detectors achieve equal-error rates between 9.6\% and 10.2\%. The results-along with the shared data and evaluation methodology-constitute a benchmark for comparing detectors and measuring progress.},

In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discriminative features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions.

  abstract = {Personal keystroke modes are difficult to imitate and can therefore be used for identity authentication. The keystroke habits of a person can be learned according to the keystroke data generated when the person inputs free text. Detecting a user’s keystroke habits as the user enters text can continuously verify the user’s identity without affecting user input. The method proposed in this paper authenticates users via their keystrokes when they type free text. The user keystroke data is divided into a fixed-length keystroke sequence, which is then converted into a keystroke vector sequence according to the time feature of the keystroke. A model that combines a convolutional neural network and a recursive neural network is used to learn a sequence of individual keystroke vectors to obtain individual keystroke features for identity authentication. The model is tested using two open datasets, and the best false rejection rate (FRR) is found to be (2.07\%,6.61\%), the best false acceptance rate (FAR) is found to be (3.26\%, 5.31\%), and the best equal error rate (EER) is found to be (2.67\%, 5.97\%).},

Keystroke dynamics are processed using Wavelet Transform Filtering (WTF) to improve feature extraction, while gait data is refined with an Autocorrelation (AC) Filter to ensure the use of reliable gait segments. Experimental results demonstrate that the multi-modal fusion approach significantly enhances authentication accuracy, achieving a combined accuracy of 98.25\% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.35\%.

Traditional methods of authentication fail to provide full assurance as they can be bypassed by skilled attackers. Additionally, existing systems suffer from repeated login issues that hamper the user experience. Biometric user authentication has emerged as a potential alternative to other schemes and has proven to provide adequate security. This paper proposes a continuous authentication system using multimodal biometrics based on face and keystroke dynamics. A novel Adaptive Weighted Sum Score Fusion (AWSSF) approach is introduced, which considers environmental factors and the user's profile in addition to the biometrics employed in the decision process.

  abstract = {Behavioral Biometrics (BB) Continuous Authentication (CA) systems monitor user behavior and continuously re-authenticate user identity alongside the initial login process. Most studies use single behavioral modality systems to authenticate users. However, the behaviors of genuine users may change, and systems fail when significant changes occur. This results in either usability or security issues. In the literature, the fusion of biometrics is used to solve this problem and achieves improved results. This paper presents our research on the design and evaluation of new approaches to CA using fusion of touch gestures and keystroke dynamics. To collect the biometric data from mobile device users we have developed the BioGames App which follows an innovative approach based on the gamification paradigm. We examine each modality separately and investigate if we can improve the performance results with a feature-level fusion. For this reason, a new appropriate feature set is developed that combines touch gestures and keystroke dynamics. We used the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and compared their performance. We have shown that feature-level fusion of touch gestures and keystroke dynamics improves the performance of systems and solves security and usability issues. We found that the MLP is superior to LSTM in this context. The MLP achieved Accuracy 98.3\% (increased 21.1\%), EER 1\% (error reduction by 23.7\%), TAR 99.4\% (increased 46\%), TRR 97.4\% (increased 10\%), FAR 2.6\% (reduced by 10.5\%), and FRR 0.6\% (reduced by 46\%).},

We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6\% to 93.2\% and from 88.0\% to 93.8\% on Omniglot compared to competing approaches.

Complexvalued CNNs, on the other hand, can provide amplitude and phase information to enhance the feature representation ability based on the proposed complex metric module (CMM). Building upon the recent episodic training mechanism, CMMs can improve the representation capacity by extracting robust complex-valued features to facilitate the modeling of subtle relationships among few-shot samples. Furthermore, we use Dependable Learning as a new learning paradigm, to promote a robust model against perturbation based on a new bilinear optimization to enhance the feature extraction capacity for very few available intra-class samples.
