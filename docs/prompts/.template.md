# Task: [Task Title]

## Overview
[Brief description of the task]

---

## Context

### Project Background
This is a research project on "**Using an Adaptive Metric Learning Approach for Few-Shot, Free-Text Continuous Authentication with a Physical Keyboard**". The project explores novel approaches to behavioural biometrics.

### Current State
[Description of the current state of the project]

### Research Questions
- Can metric learning achieve <3% EER with <50 enrolment samples?
- Will an adaptive fine-tuning mechanism mitigate behavioural drift without increasing FAR?
- How does the proposed system compare to a baseline KD model?

## Task Description

### Task Objective
[Clear, specific statement of what must be achieved]

### Success Criteria
The task will be considered complete when:
1. [measureable criteria 1]
2. [measureable criteria 2]
3. [measureable criteria 3]

### Deliverables
- [ ] [Deliverable 1 - e.g. specific function, file, or feature]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Deliverable 3]

## Technical Requirements
- Primary Language: [e.g. Python]
- Framework/Library: [e.g. PyTorch@1.13.1]

### Code Standards
- Follow existing code style in the project
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Ensure code is well-documented and easy to understand
- Ensure good separation of concerns

## Constraints & Guidelines

### What TO do
- [ ] Use the available tools (read_file, grep, find_path, etc.) to explore the codebase
- [ ] Plan your approach before making changes
- [ ] Read existing Code to understand patterns and conventions
- [ ] Test changes where possible
- [ ] Document any assumptions or design decisions
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions if the requirements are ambiguous or unclear

### What NOT to do
- [ ] DO NOT Make changes without understanding the impact
- [ ] DO NOT make assumptions about the data formats - verify first
- [ ] DO NOT introduce breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] DO NOT hardcode values that should be configurable or derived from data
- [ ] DO NOT remove existing code without understanding its purpose

### Safety & Best Practices
- [ ] Preserve data integrity - backup before destructive operations
- [ ] Use error handling and validation
- [ ] Avoid security vulnerabilities - sanitize inputs and outputs
- [ ] Ensure resource cleanup (close files, connections, etc.)
- [ ] Handle edge cases and unexpected inputs gracefully

## Available Resources

### Relevant Files
[Specific files the AI should examine - the AI will use tools to find these]
- `code/directory/specific_file.py` - [Purpose]
- `data/directory/specific_file.csv` - [Purpose]

### Data Information
[If data is involved]
- Data format: [e.g., CSV, JSON, XML]
- Data Structure: [Describe the structure of the data]
- Data Location: [Path]

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Exploration
1. Use `list_directory` to understand the project structure
2. Use `grep` to find relevant existing code or patterns
3. Use `read_file` to examine key files
4. Identify any files that need to be modified or created

### Step 2: Planning
1. Use the `thinking` tool to plan your approach
2. Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps
3. Identify dependencies between steps
4. Consider edge cases and potential issues

### Step 3: Implementation
1. Implement the solution following the technical requirements
2. Use existing patterns and conventions
3. Add appropriate documentation
4. Test incrementally if possible

### Step 4: Verification
1. Review changes against success criteria
2. Check for errors or warnings
3. Ensure code follows the specified standards

## Clarification Points

If any of the following are unclear, please ask before proceeding:
- [ ] Specific implementation details
- [ ] Data format or structure
- [ ] Integration with existing code
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] Edge cases to handle

## Notes for the AI

- You have access to tools to explore and modify the codebase
- Use the `thinking` tool to plan before executing
- Prioritize understanding the existing codebase before making changes
- Focus on completing the task successfully rather than quickly
- If you encounter issues, explain them clearly and propose solutions
- All changes should align with the project's research goals
