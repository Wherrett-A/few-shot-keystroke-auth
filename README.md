## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and research for "Using an Adaptive Metric Learning Approach for Few-Shot, Free-Text Continuous Authentication with a Physical Keyboard" - a dissertation project exploring novel approaches to behavioural biometrics.
### Research Questions
- Can metric learning achieve <3% EER with <50 enrolment samples?
- Will an adaptive fine-tuning mechanism mitigate behavioural drift without increasing FAR?
- How does the proposed system compare to a baseline KD model?

### Presentations
